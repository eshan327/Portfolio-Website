# About Me

## Hi, I'm Eshan Khan

I'm a Computer Science and Mathematics student at the University of Maryland with a passion for building impactful software. I thrive at the intersection of elegant algorithms and practical engineering, whether that's optimizing machine learning models, designing full-stack applications, or crafting interactive visualizations.

I'm driven by curiosity and love tackling complex technical challenges. From achieving 94.2% accuracy on audio classification models to building e-commerce platforms serving thousands of users, I bring both rigor and creativity to every project.
