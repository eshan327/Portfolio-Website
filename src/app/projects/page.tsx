            Beyond these public projects, I&apos;ve worked on numerous academic projects that have significantly contributed to my growth as a developer. These include a C compiler built in OCaml, a Rust-powered garbage collector, a command line shell in C, and many more. While these projects aren&apos;t publicly shareable here, they&apos;ve provided invaluable experience in systems programming, compiler design, DSA, and object-oriented and functional paradigms.
