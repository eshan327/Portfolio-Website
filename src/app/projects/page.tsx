          Beyond these public projects, I've worked on numerous academic projects that have significantly contributed to my growth as a developer. These include a C compiler built in OCaml, a Rust-powered garbage collector, a command line shell in C, and many more. While these projects aren't publicly shareable, they've provided invaluable experience in systems programming, compiler design, DSA, and object-oriented and functional paradigms.
